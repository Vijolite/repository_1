    "From the clustering we see that Hemel Hempstead and Cheshunt, what both hs similarity in the luck of popular Italian/Pizza places, are in different clusters, so do not have a lot of other similarities; the same about Hoddesdon and Bishop's Stortford - they also have similar Italian/Pizza popular places amount and for both of them Italian restaunant is in top 3, but they are in different clusters, so  there are not a lot of more similarieties. From the other side, we see also a contrexample - Berkhamsted and Rickmansworth are in one cluster and also have similar amount of popular Italian/Pizza places. So actually there are no big correlation between general similarity in popular places and similarity in having close relative amount of Italian/Pizza places"
